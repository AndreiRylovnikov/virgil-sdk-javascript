# Decrypting Data

This guide is a short tutorial on how to **decrypt** encrypted data with Virgil Security.

Decryption is the reverse operation of encryption. As previously noted, Virgil Security allows you to encrypt data using public-key encryption. It's means that only the owner of the related private **Virgil Key**  can decrypt the encrypted data.

Set up your project environment before you start to decrypt data, with the [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client.md) guide.

The Data Decryption procedure is shown in the figure below.

To decrypt a **message**, Bob needs:
 - His Virgil Key

Let's review the data decryption process:

1. Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**:

```javascript
var api = virgil.API("[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]");
```

#{ export "initialize_without_token" }

```javascript
var api = virgil.API();
```


2. Then Bob:


  - Loads the Virgil Key from the secure storage provided by default
  - Decrypts the message using his own Virgil Key

  #{ export "data_decryption" }
  ```javascript
  // load Key
  api.keys.load("[KEY_NAME]", "[KEY_PASSWORD]")
      .then(function (bobKey) {
          // decrypt the message.
          var originalMessage = bobKey.decrypt(ciphertext).toString();
      });
  ```

To load a Virgil Key from a specific storage, developers need to change the storage path during Virgil SDK initialization.

To decrypt data, you will need Bob's stored Virgil Key. See the [Storing Keys](/docs/guides/virgil-key/saving-key.md) guide for more details.
